This project analyses properties of graphs from input, starting from basic ones, such as degree sequence or number of components to more complicated ones, like vertex coloring. All functionalities are following: 
- the degree sequence
- the number of components
- bipartiteness
- the eccentricity of vertices (within the components)
- vertex coloring obtained using algorithms: greedy (the vertex order according to its number) and LF (largest-first)
- the number of the graph complement's edges
  
The main goal was to implement the fastest possible algorithms, fast enough even for really dense graphs.
